## About project
A typing game that is build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## How to use
The project can be runned in a localhost (like XAMPP).

## Programming concepts
A) HTML (index.html) - HTML writes the basic structure of the webpage. The basic display such as the text (name of the game, explanation of the game) to buttons like the start button. Class and ID selectors are also written using HTML to allow CSS or Javascript to identify which part of the webpage it needs to apply it's functions. It also has references linking to both the CSS and JavaScript file.

B) CSS (main.css) - By using the class and ID selectors written using HTML, the page is being styled and designed using CSS so that it looks better. CSS is also used by JavaScript in order to highlight portions of the words where users have correctly input or typed.

C) JavaScript (main.js) - JavaScript is the main code used to allow page to function. The timer counting down, the display of random words from a textfile and the checking of user input vs the word displayed onscreen is all done using JavaScript. JavaScript uses the class and id selectors that is previously written using HTML to indentify the elements to apply the functions appopriate on them. Functions are created and the press of the start button will run those functions. Further explanation of coding are in the comments of the main.js file.
